- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

The I/O operation (readFile) is executed first in the poll phase with the callback added/executed in the pending callbacks. As the callback is executed, the setTimeout and 
setImmediate operations are added to the timers and check queues respectively. The check phase then executes the setImmediate operation since it has the 
next-highest priority. Finally, the setTimeout operation executes once it has moved to pending callbacks.

Even if setTimeout's delay is set to 0, the callback is immediately sent to pending callbacks but the order does not change since the check phase 
always executes its operations before pending callbacks.
